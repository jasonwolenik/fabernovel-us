This marks the return of the first section, which brings you information about the future that’s already here. Read on to find out more about the latest technological gems and trends that are emerging on our favorite crowdfunding platforms.

And since the previous and first issue, we have already witnessed the rise of Indiegogo, the challenger to Kickstarter: it has completed the largest fundraising drive ever carried out by a crowdfunding site ($40 million in January) and welcomed several new, prestigious investors last May, including Sir Richard Branson (Virgin), Megan Smith (Google X) and Max Levchin (PayPal).

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: we all need to monitor the latest developments from these sites, and we’re setting an example at FABERNOVEL by sharing this information every three months. It’s the most useful way to understand what’s going on before taking action. We’ll also provide the latest updates on the GAFA, a.k.a. the Fantastic Four. Spoiler alert: they will also be the subject of FABERNOVEL’s current research and development efforts…stay tuned for more information.

As with all long-term trends, we sometimes run across ideas that have hit rock bottom: you might think it’s ridiculous to raise over $70,000 by crowdfunding a **recipe for potato salad**, and I’m not trying to say that soon we’ll all be eating potato salad. And unfortunately we won’t all be able to raise thousands of dollars for our grandmothers’ favorite recipes, either.  But there are both hidden gems as well as duds (or should I say “spuds”) on these sites, representing the crème de la crème as well as the latest ridiculousness of our times, and what a delicious blend they make — like an almanac of what’s to come.

For this third quarter, we’ve noted a major stand-out trend: the **return of virtual reality**, spearheaded by the success of the Oculus Rift. And as we all know, large, well-established companies are not the only ones that can dream big: several very young (and small) companies have decided to seize the opportunities offered by virtual reality, which was one of the issues highlighted at [the Futur en Seine digital festival](http://www.futur-en-seine.fr/fens2014/).

This is a reminder that one of the most radical changes that has occurred in the past ten years is the widespread availability of highly persuasive tools and interfaces that are interoperable with open platforms, all at a reasonable cost. With just a few clicks of the mouse, anyone can now develop experiments and prototypes. And at FABERNOVEL, we have decided to strengthen this expertise, in particular with our Tech Playground format, which we encourage you to learn more about: **connected objects are everywhere**, so it’s only natural that they have become the second major trend on platforms this quarter. The rise in sensors as well as movements such as “3D printing for all” foreshadow an extension of the ways in which these objects are incorporated into our connected lives. And **French Tech** has not been left behind! 

And yet, in the face of this onslaught of products, we have seen **a resurgence of software-based projects**, which sometimes border on becoming an online “black market.” The concepts of a **regulated internet versus an anonymous internet** are coming into conflict due to the rise of an **“on demand”**, increasingly collaborative and independent economy.  

Finally, we take a look at **minimalist user interfaces**, starting with the recent success of Bttn and YO. Does this minimalism herald the **liberation of users**?

 In the next issue we’ll take a tour of GitHub to talk about some technical matters and draw a few lessons — we promise. Until then, focus on your bathing suit rather than the potato salad recipe.

**Yo!**

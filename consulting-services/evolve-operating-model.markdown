Innovation is just as important for internal functions as customer-facing activities. Some of the most successful organizations have outperformed competitors by implementing innovative strategies to improve their operational performance and profitability. 

Successfully capturing internal innovation requires challenging established business models and identifying new ways to grow and improve capabilities- from knowledge sharing to supply chain management. 

**How can an organization evolve the operating model to achieve efficiency, speed and flexibility required in today’s marketplace?**

FABERNOVEL believes there is a five-step process to defining and prototyping new, scalable operating models: 

1. **Assess the current performance** - Obsess over your firm’s KPIs  

2. **Explore new solutions** - Discover innovative ways to improve how your firm operates 

3. **Validate the business case** – Realistically assess the improvements against costs

4. **Create a new operating model** – Devise an operational plan that works for your organization

5. **Prototype solution and scale** – Practice, learn, and then launch
